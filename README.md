# 🎓 Campus Placement Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Campus Placement Salary Prediction** project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts a student’s **likelihood of securing a job** during campus placements and **estimates the expected salary**.  

By analyzing **historical placement data**, the system evaluates various factors such as:
- 📖 Academic performance (high school, UG, PG marks)  
- 💼 Work experience (internships, previous roles)  
- 💻 Technical skills & aptitude  

This model provides **valuable insights** for students, placement cells, and universities to improve employability and optimize the placement process.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Predict placement probability for students  
- ✅ Estimate expected salary based on profile  
- ✅ Identify strengths & weaknesses of students  
- ✅ Assist universities in guiding **at-risk students**  
- ✅ Support career growth and better job opportunities  

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Historical placement records  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, normalization, feature selection  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Academic marks, internships, technical skills, aptitude scores  
4. **Model Training** – Using supervised ML algorithms (Regression, Classification, etc.)  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, R² score  
6. **Prediction** – Placement probability & salary estimation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  
- **ML Models:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  

---

## 📌 Expected Outcomes
- 📈 **Students** → Personalized insights to improve employability  
- 🏫 **Universities** → Identify & guide at-risk students  
- 💼 **Companies** → Efficient candidate shortlisting  
- 🎯 **Overall** → Optimized placement process
